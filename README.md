> **A biologging database of juvenile white sharks from the northeast Pacific** — replication study.
> Reference paper: [10.1038/s41597-022-01235-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01235-3)

This is a self-contained replication of the headline claim of the reference paper. It produces a reproducible computational pipeline, a Zenodo-archived release with a citable DOI, and a FORRT-tagged nanopublication chain on the [Science Live platform](https://platform.sciencelive4all.org).

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annefou/white-shark-geolocation-light.git
cd white-shark-geolocation-light
pixi install
pixi run snakemake --cores 1
```

(Pixi resolves `pixi.toml` against the per-platform `pixi.lock`, installs the env under `.pixi/`, and provides `pixi run` for any task without needing an `activate` step.)

### Copernicus Marine credential (required for the temperature factor)

The temperature emission matches the tags' dive-temperature record against **GLORYS12V1** ocean reanalysis, downloaded by notebook 01 via `copernicusmarine`. You need a free [Copernicus Marine](https://marine.copernicus.eu/) account. Create the credentials file once:

```bash
pixi run copernicusmarine login   # writes ~/.copernicusmarine/.copernicusmarine-credentials
```

In **CI**, set the repository secret **`COPERNICUS_CREDENTIALS_BASE64`** to a base64-encoded INI file:

```
[credentials]
username=YOUR_USERNAME
password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

(`base64 -w0 the-ini-file`). The `ci.yml` and `jupyter-book.yml` workflows decode it to `~/.copernicusmarine/.copernicusmarine-credentials` before running the pipeline. The light, bathymetry (ETOPO) and biologging (DataONE) downloads need **no** credentials.

The GLORYS download is **idempotent** — tags whose `data/clean/reference_model_<tag>_gulfext.nc` reference model is already on disk are skipped, so a re-run does not re-fetch.

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/annefou/white-shark-geolocation-light:latest
```

The Jupyter Book version is at <https://annefou.github.io/white-shark-geolocation-light/>.

## Built from a template

This repository was created from [`sciencelivehub/forrt-replication-template`](https://github.com/sciencelivehub/forrt-replication-template). The template ships an operating manual for AI assistants ([`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)), domain conventions ([`DOMAIN.md`](DOMAIN.md)), and reference docs (`docs/`) so that an AI working only inside this repository can guide a researcher from "paper PDF + GitHub repo" to "published FORRT chain + Zenodo DOI" with no other context.

If you are reading this in a fresh fork, run [`/init-template`](.claude/skills/init-template/SKILL.md) inside Claude Code to substitute the placeholder tokens with your details. (For other AI tools, see [`docs/ai-portability.md`](docs/ai-portability.md).)

After `/init-template`, do these one-time setup steps to enable the full CI/CD path:

- **Enable GitHub Pages** at *Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions*. Until enabled, the Jupyter Book build runs but the deploy step is skipped (CI stays green).
- The CI workflows ship with **scaffold-detection guards** — they run end-to-end only after you implement Phase 2 (the `notebooks/*.py` files). Until then they exit early with an informative `::notice::` and the badges stay green.

## What you get

This template bakes in conventions that took multiple replications to discover. By using it, you inherit:

- **FAIR4RS conformance** — see [`docs/fair4rs-checklist.md`](docs/fair4rs-checklist.md) for the principle-by-principle mapping.
- **Self-contained data downloads** — the first notebook fetches everything; no manual data prep.
- **`pixi.toml` + `pixi.lock` as single source of truth** — local dev, Docker, and CI all install the same per-platform-pinned env.
- **`prefix-dev/setup-pixi`-based CI** — caches the env, runs the pipeline with `pixi run`, executes notebooks via a glob, fails fast on a stale lockfile.
- **Jupyter Book deployment** — auto-deploys to GitHub Pages with `BASE_URL` set correctly. (Don't put `base_url` in `myst.yml` — MyST silently ignores it.)
- **Docker + GHCR + Zenodo image archival** — `release` trigger pushes to GHCR and (optionally) archives to Zenodo for long-term preservation.
- **RO-Crate packaging** — the entire repo is a navigable Research Object via `ro-crate-metadata.json` (Process Run Crate + Workflow RO-Crate profiles).
- **Six-step FORRT chain workspace** — `nanopubs/drafts/` has a field-by-field skeleton for each step. `nanopubs/PUBLISHED.md` is the URI registry.
- **Layered AI guidance** — `CLAUDE.md` (universal) + `DOMAIN.md` (swappable per field) + `USER_PREFERENCES.md` (per-user). See [`docs/ai-portability.md`](docs/ai-portability.md) for non-Claude AI tools.
- **Sandbox by default** — `.claude/settings.json` denies file ops outside the repo, so a fresh AI session can't accidentally read `~/.ssh/` or write to `/etc/`.

## The six FORRT chain steps

A complete FORRT chain has six steps published on [platform.sciencelive4all.org](https://platform.sciencelive4all.org):

```
Quote-with-comment  →  AIDA  →  FORRT Claim  →  Replication Study  →  Replication Outcome  →  CiTO Citation
```

(For question-rooted chains with no upstream paper, replace step 1 with PICO or PCC. See [`docs/chain-decision-tree.md`](docs/chain-decision-tree.md).)

Drafts live in [`nanopubs/drafts/`](nanopubs/drafts/) field-by-field. Published URIs go into [`nanopubs/PUBLISHED.md`](nanopubs/PUBLISHED.md).

Optional further layers:

- **Research Software nanopub** — for reusable upstream tools (not demo repos). See [`docs/forrt-form-fields.md`](docs/forrt-form-fields.md) § Research Software.
- **Research Synthesis nanopub** — when this chain is part of a multi-chain story. See [`docs/forrt-form-fields.md`](docs/forrt-form-fields.md) § Research Synthesis.

## After publishing

When the chain is live and the FAIR4RS checklist is green, drafting an announcement post is the next step. See [`docs/announcement-template.md`](docs/announcement-template.md) for the structural template (vision-piece-first; the worked replication is the payoff, not the lead).

For lower-level nanopub work — retraction, superseding, batch publishing — see [`docs/programmatic-nanopubs.md`](docs/programmatic-nanopubs.md).
